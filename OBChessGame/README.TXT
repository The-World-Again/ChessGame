Description: This is a recreation of the game, "Chess."
If you do not know the game rules they are as follows:
The pawn can move 1 square forward, or 2 squares on its first move. It can take diagonally forward one square.
The bishop can move diagonally in all 4 directions.
The knight moves in an "L" pattern, 2 squares in a cardinal direction, then 1 to either side.
The rook can move cardinally in all 4 directions.
The queen can move like both a rook and a bishop.
Your king is your most important piece, as it decides whether you win or lose.
You win by checkmating the other king, or attacking it while also leaving it no squares to move to.
You lose if you get checkmated.
Stalemates occur if one player has no possible moves.
"Checking" is when your king is under attack. You have to escape the check if you are in check.
